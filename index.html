		<h1> Gloria Chim (she/her) | AGPM 2024 </h1>

		<p> Heya! The name's Gloria Chim (she/her), and I'm a third year Art and
		Games: Playable Media major (AGPM)! I play lots of video games on PC and I
		like to draw traditionally and digitally (my main art program is Clip Studio
		Paint, but I'm well acquainted with Adobe programs as well). I've dabbled in
		some HTML/CSS in highschool, and I took CSE 20/30 before, so I know a bit of
		Python. However, I feel like I haven't practiced enough coding to be
		efficient at it. I hope to learn more and improve my coding
		confidence/skills this Fall! </p>
