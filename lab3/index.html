			<h1>Lab 3 File Structures </h1>
			<p> In this lab, we went overa and reviewed local file structures on our
				local computers and modified the index.html files. </p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p> The challenges that I had faced was trying to distinguish between
			the index.html in different folders - I have to be concious of what
		 	index.html file I am modifying. </p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> If you are seeing this webpage, and you're able to interact
			with said the webpage, it means that I have succeeded!
			Below is the screenshoted proof of the file structure I've created
		 	and used:</p>
